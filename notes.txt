1. In this project, I have saved the preprocessor and model as a seperate pickle files. Because we pass the cleaned and processed 
train and test data to my ANN model. Done the train test split and applied the transformation on them  in my data_transformation.py
and saved my preprocessor.pkl.
2. *** There wont be any data leakage because I am not doing any explicit CV during my model training.
3. Normal and Tensorboard logs are created
To view the tensor board logs run the below command in the terminal(cmd):
tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit
And you get a link like this click on it-  http://localhost:6006/

Deployed the application using the streamlit. Here is the link:
